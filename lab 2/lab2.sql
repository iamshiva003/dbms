-- 2. Consider the following schema for Order Database:
-- SALESMAN (Salesman_id, Name, City, Commission)
-- CUSTOMER (Customer_id, Cust_Name, City, Grade,Salesman_id)
-- ORDERS (Ord_No, Purchase_Amt, Ord_Date, #Customer_id, Salesman_id)
    -- Write SQL queries to
    -- i. Count the customers with grades above Bangalore’s average.
    -- ii. Find the name and numbers of all salesmen who had more than one customer.
    -- iii. List all salesmen and indicate those who have and don’t have customers in their cities (Use UNION operation.)
    -- iv. Create a view that finds the salesman who has the customer with the highest order of a day.
    -- v. Demonstrate the DELETE operation by removing salesman with id 1000. All his orders must also be deleted.

-- displaying the values from the tables
select * from salesman;

-- i. Count the customers with grades above Bangalore’s average.
select count(*) from customer where grade > (select avg(grade) from customer where city = 'Bangalore');

-- ii. Find the name and numbers of all salesmen who had more than one customer.
